# Smart-secure-door-bell
Using a voice assistant, Amazon Alexa and few connected hardware components like cameras, lights and Raspberry-pi, we propose to develop a unique system that not only lets you know who is at the door but also make our system to turn the lights on for the owner of the house when our system recognizes his/her car by reading the license plate of car. In addition, our proposed system sets up a phone call with owner when someone is at door and owner is out of home. If there is anyone trying to deliver goods like UPS, USPS our smart system recognizes him and lets the owner know that it was a postal delivery. Our system helps in recognizing thieves by comparing faces of each person with a criminal database.
